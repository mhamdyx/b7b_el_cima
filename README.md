## Model Architecture

* We learned 3 different architectures
you can find all details [here](Model_Arch.md).

* By comparing the initial results of them the one which gave the best result was U-Net so we continue training on it.

* We trained it by 66k images from old colored movies. you can find the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g6wtlkZVHAMKwucdRPqke37aBcQaImWw/view).

* The training took 2 days on colab to make 20 epochs with batch size 32.
